# type-a

inspired by typings.gg

## Why did I do this?

I really like mechanical keyboards and typing.

I also wanted to learn more about front end development and react. I really enjoy using
typings.gg, so I wanted to make a typing test in the same realm as it, but made in
react.

I plan on adding some more features that typings doesn't have, such as a leaderboard, a few different
modes (one word in the word box for focusing, hard mode where what you type shows up as password dots, infinite mode, etc),
and any other things that I thing of.

Feel free to open issues or pull requests with features that you'd like to see. I'd like to implement the initial functionality
of the typing test myself, but will definitely look at any issues or PRs.

Thanks!
